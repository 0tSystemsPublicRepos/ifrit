# 🔥FRIT Proxy - START HERE

Welcome! This file will guide you through the complete IFRIT Documentation package.

## What is IFRIT? (2-Minute Overview)

IFRIT is an intelligent reverse proxy that sits between attackers and your infrastructure.

When an attack comes in, IFRIT makes a smart decision:
- Is this obviously malicious? → Block with honeypot
- Is it a pattern we've seen before? → Block with cached response
- Do we need to ask Claude/Gemini? → Analyze and block
- Is it legitimate? → Pass through

If it's an attack, IFRIT serves **fake data** back to the attacker (fake credentials, fake database records, etc.). This tricks the attacker while revealing their tools and techniques.

IFRIT learns continuously. Each attack analyzed becomes a learned pattern. After one week, 80% of attacks are caught instantly from the local database without external API calls.

## Key Concepts (5-Minute Summary)

### Three Execution Modes

**Onboarding Mode** (Days 1-7 of deployment)
- Allow all paths
- Zero false positives
- Automatic baseline creation
- Best for: New deployment

**Normal Mode** (aka Deception)
- Full detection pipeline enabled
- Honeypot responses for attacks
- Real-time pattern learning
- Claude/Gemini integration
- Best for: Active threat defense

### Two Detection Modes

**Detection Mode** (Default)
- Smart threat analysis
- Learns attack patterns
- Optional whitelist for exceptions
- ~3% false positive rate possible
- Best for: Standard deployments

**Allowlist Mode** 
- Strict access control
- Only whitelisted IPs/paths allowed
- Everything else blocked
- Zero false positives (by design)
- Best for: VPN-only, admin portals, strict zero-trust
- Optional: You can enabled headers/requests body analysis for allowed users/IPs

### Four-Stage Detection Pipeline
```
Stage 0: Whitelist Check
├─ Is IP whitelisted? → ALLOW ✓
├─ Is path whitelisted? → CHECK FLAG
│  ├─ skip_body_check_on_whitelist=true → ALLOW ✓
│  └─ skip_body_check_on_whitelist=false → Continue
└─ Continue to Stage 1

Stage 1: Local Rules
├─ Matches obvious attack? → HONEYPOT ✓
└─ Continue to Stage 2

Stage 2: Database Patterns
├─ Matches learned pattern? → HONEYPOT ✓
└─ Continue to Stage 3

Stage 3: LLM Analysis
├─ Claude/Gemini confirms attack? → HONEYPOT ✓
└─ Is legitimate → Forward to backend ✓
```

### New in 0.1.1: Skip Body Check Flag

Control whether whitelisted paths still get checked:
```json
{
  "detection": {
    "skip_body_check_on_whitelist": false
  }
}
```

- `true`: Whitelisted paths skip ALL checks (fastest)
- `false`: Whitelisted paths still check body/headers (catches malicious payloads)

**Example use case:** Path `/health` is whitelisted, but still detect if body contains SQL injection

---

## Quick Start (10 minutes)

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0tSystemsPublicRepos/ifrit.git
cd ifrit
```

### 2. Configure
```bash
cp config/default.json.example config/default.json
```

Edit `config/default.json` and add your Claude/Gemini API key under the relevant section:
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "claude": {
      "api_key": "sk-ant-YOUR-KEY-HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Build
```bash
go build -o ifrit ./cmd/ifrit
go build -o ifrit-cli ./cmd/ifrit-cli
```

### 4. Run
```bash
./ifrit
```

Server starts on `:8080` (proxy) and `:8443` (API).

### 5. Test
```bash
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8080/.env

# Check CLI
./ifrit-cli exception list
```

## New in 0.2.0: Threat Intelligence & Notifications

### Threat Intelligence System

IFRIT now enriches detected attacks with data from:
- **AbuseIPDB** - IP reputation and abuse history
- **VirusTotal** - Malware detection
- **IPInfo** - Geolocation and privacy detection (VPN/proxy/hosting)

Each IP gets a **risk score (0-100)** and **threat level**:
- 🚨 **CRITICAL** (80-100) - Immediate threat
- ⚠️ **HIGH** (60-79) - Significant threat
- ⚡ **MEDIUM** (40-59) - Notable activity
- ℹ️ **LOW** (0-39) - Low risk

**View threat intelligence:**
```bash
# List all enriched IPs
./ifrit-cli threat list

# Get details for specific IP
./ifrit-cli threat view 192.168.1.100

# See top 10 most dangerous IPs
./ifrit-cli threat top 10

# Get statistics
./ifrit-cli threat stats
```

### Notification System with Rule-Based Filtering

Control when you get alerts! IFRIT now supports multiple notification channels:

**Available Channels:**
- 📧 Email (SMTP)
- 💬 Slack
- 📱 SMS (Twilio)
- 🔗 Custom Webhooks

**Rule-Based Filtering:** Configure which threat levels trigger alerts:
```json
"notifications": {
  "rules": {
    "alert_on_critical": true,   // Always alert on CRITICAL
    "alert_on_high": false,       // Skip HIGH alerts
    "alert_on_medium": false,     // Skip MEDIUM alerts
    "alert_on_low": false         // Skip LOW alerts
  }
}
```

**Example:** Only get notified of CRITICAL threats
- SQL Injection with risk score 85 → ✅ SEND ALERT
- XSS with risk score 50 → ❌ SKIP (MEDIUM, disabled)
- Brute force with risk score 30 → ❌ SKIP (LOW, disabled)

**View notification history:**
```bash
# Check what alerts were sent
curl -H "X-API-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8443/api/notifications/history
```

### Enhanced Dashboard

The dashboard now shows:
- 🚨 CRITICAL threat count
- ⚠️ HIGH threat count
- ⚡ MEDIUM threat count
- ℹ️ LOW threat count
- 🔥 **Top Risky IPs** - Most dangerous attackers with risk scores

Access at: `http://localhost:8443/`

### New API Endpoints
```bash
# Get threat intelligence statistics
GET /api/threat-intel/stats

# List all enriched IPs
GET /api/threat-intel/list?limit=50

# Get details for specific IP
GET /api/threat-intel/view?ip=192.168.1.100

# Get top threats by risk score
GET /api/threat-intel/top?limit=10

# View/update notification settings
GET /api/notifications/config
POST /api/notifications/config/update

# Check notification history
GET /api/notifications/history
```

## Common Questions

### Q: How long does it take to get started?
**A:** 10 minutes. Clone, configure API key, build, run.

### Q: Do I need to modify my application code?
**A:** No. IFRIT is a reverse proxy - zero code changes needed.

### Q: Will IFRIT block legitimate traffic?
**A:** Not in Onboarding Mode. Use that for 1 week to establish baseline. After that, ~5% false positive rate in Detection Mode, 0% in Allowlist Mode.

### Q: How much does it cost?
**A:** Free to deploy. If it helps you, consider: ⭐ starring on GitHub, contributing, or [buying us a coffee ☕](mailto:ifrit@0t.systems). Optional Claude/Gemini API costs: ~$0.30 for first week of learning, then 90% savings via caching. 

### Q: Can I run multiple IFRIT instances?
**A:** Yes, with shared database (not fully tested, need network-mounted SQLite or PostgreSQL support coming soon).

### Q: What if Claude/Gemini are down?
**A:** IFRIT falls back to config defaults and whitelist mode. Still protects against known patterns.

### Q: How is my data handled?
**A:** Sensitive data (tokens, credentials, emails) is anonymized before sending to Claude/Gemini. See ANONYMIZATION_TESTING.md.

### Q: Can I use IFRIT with other security tools?
**A:** Yes. IFRIT works alongside IDS/IPS, WAF, firewalls, etc. It's complementary, not a replacement.

## Execution Mode Decision Tree
```
Starting fresh deployment?
├─ YES → Use Onboarding Mode for 1 week
│        └─ After 1 week → Switch to Detection Mode
│
└─ NO → Choose based on use case:
         ├─ Need strict access control? → Allowlist(by IP + PATH) + optionally analyze headers/body for whitelisted users+paths
         ├─ Want smart threat analysis + Active Deception? → Detection Mode + LLM Analysis + Dynamic Payload generation
         └─ Testing/learning? → Onboarding Mode (Allow all incoming traffic, no filtering or analysis, all traffic IS ADDED AS ALLOWED IN DATABASE EXCEPTIONS)
```

---

## Detection Mode Decision Tree
```
How strict do you need to be?
├─ Very strict (VPN-only, admin portal) → Allowlist Mode
├─ Standard (web app, public endpoints) → Detection Mode
└─ Learning (need baseline first) → Onboarding Mode
```

---

## Performance Expectations

| Operation | Speed | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Whitelist check | <1ms | 1000 requests/sec |
| Local rules | <5ms | 200 requests/sec |
| DB pattern match | <10ms | 100 requests/sec |
| LLM analysis | ~3 seconds | 0.3 requests/sec |
| Learned pattern reuse | <10ms | 100 requests/sec |

**Real-world:** 95% of requests use learned patterns (<10ms). Only 5% of new attacks trigger LLM (~3s).
